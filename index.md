# Johnny 5
An experimental military robot that is struck by lightning and gains a humanlike intelligence, with which it embarks to explore.

The robot finds itself in Astoria, Oregon, and is found by Stephanie Speck, an animal care-giver, who mistakes him for an alien. She takes the robot into her home, where she provides him with "input" in the form of visual and verbal stimuli, allowing the robot to improve its language skills, and eventually names itself "Number 5", being the fifth prototype produced.
